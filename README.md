# Bikes_Sales Project

Welcome to the **Bikes_Sales** project! This project includes an Excel file named `1_Dashboard` and a PowerPoint file named `2_Report`. Below are the instructions and details for each component.

## Dashboard 📊

The `Dashboard` file contains cleaned and organized data, along with interactive elements to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Steps Taken:

2. **Navigate** through the hidden sheets to view how to create different pivot tables and charts starting from raw data.
3. **Interact** with the charts in the `Dashboard` sheet using the rulers to filter and analyze data.
